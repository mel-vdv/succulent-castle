With their bright colors, original shapes, and amazing ability to thrive with so little, succulents are the perfect symbol of resilience — always her, ever present. To cultivate this magic, I traveled the world: from California to Alabama, through Sweden, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. From carefully selected seeds, I recreated new strains, unique and robust, ready to brighten your interiors with a touch of nature and poetry.",

Flaming red, cosmic purple, solar yellow, electric blue... They shine in all the colors of the rainbow, like promises of originality and escape. Resilient and exotic, succulents are the stars of this special world — plants that aren’t afraid to shine, even when everything around dries out. <br><br> I obtained cuttings from Spain, Sweden, Italy, Portugal... and rare seeds from California and Alabama. I reproduce them locally in Belgium. <br> <br> And to enhance their glow: original creations, between poetry and curiosity: Reimagined safes, vintage finds, miniature terrariums… Each composition is designed to spark imagination and invite a touch of botanical dream into your home. <br><br> Here, nature becomes a spectacle, and every plant tells a story.",
